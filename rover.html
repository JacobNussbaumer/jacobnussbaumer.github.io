		<h2>FPV Rover</h2>
		
		

		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>This has been one of the biggest projects I worked on. I wanted to push myself and work on something more complicated than I am used to.</p>
		<p>The rover has 2 microcontrollers on it, both ESP32's. An ESP32 with a built in camera acts as the eye as well as hosting the webserver used to control it. The second one controls the motor drivers for the 6 wheel drive. The rover features rocker-boogie suspension to allow for it to driver over rough terrain.</p>

		<h3>Development</h3>
		<p>Going into the project, I had no idea how to host a webserver on a microcontroller, but I thought it would be the best way to wirelessly control it with my computer and allow me to view the camera feed. While teaching myself how to achieve this, I also struggled with the mechanical design. After much iteration and though, I finally achieved an outcome I am happy with.</p>
	
		
		
		<h3>Outcomes</h3>
		<p>I am happy with the outcome of the project, though there are countless places for improvement. I am able to control the rover via my laptop and view the live feed from the camera. Some minor stability issues occur in the stream, but the feed remains useable.</p>
		<p>There are many improvements that can be made. The electronics and mechanical design could be simplified by removing 2 of the wheels and having only 4 wheel drive. The rover is not heavy enough to require all 6 wheels. The wheels could also be improved by adding a grippy material, but I did not posses the means to fabricated that at the time.
