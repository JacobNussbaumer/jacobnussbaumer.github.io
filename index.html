		<h2>About</h2>
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>I have always enjoyed all things mechanical and robotic as long as I can remember. It has been a long journey, but I am currently a senior at Capitol Technology University studying mechatronics engineering. Along with the projects I complete at school, I enjoy building robots or other mechanical contraptions in my workshop. There is something magical about seeing a creation you designed come to life and move for the first time.</p>
		
		
		<h3>Education</h3>
		<p>I am a senior student at Capitol Technology University studying mechatronics engineering. Before attending Capitol Tech I received an associate degree in mechatronics engineering technology from Anne Arundel Community College (AACC). I had just received from AACC my associate degrees in web design and graphic design when I decided that engineering is what I wanted to pursue, so I made the switch and have no regrets.  I graduated with my associate in mechatronic engineering technology from AACC with a 3.8 GPA and currently have a 3.9 GPA at Capitol Tech</p>
